# Protein Formation
![protein formation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/219938412-67b8c9a7-3b32-489a-8905-3bd304db0005.svg)*DNA to protein, own work*
- producing proteins requires proteins
- catalysis of protein production requires rRNA
- is thought first life was RNA based

# Atomic Structure in Organic Molecules
## *geometry of bonding*
:::tip definition

ATOMIC ORBITALS:  the particular region of space in which an atoms electrons tend to reside

:::

### *shape of atomic orbitals*
![S_orbitals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/219938617-24050795-76c0-4a4c-b3da-716b80a39017.png)[^1]

:::tip definition

NODE:  phase change

:::
- the addition of waves in phase increases the amplitude (intensite)
- the addition of waves out of phase causes them to cancel out

# chemical bonding
:::tip definition

COVALENT BOND:  2 electrons shared in 2 overlapping orbital, from 2 atoms of similar energy levels

:::
### bonding molecular orbital
![bonding-molecular-orbital](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/219938946-c3d26e6f-d65e-463d-a937-1f5eb6cae226.svg)[^3]
- lower energy, as the electrons have more space
- overlap of the 1s orbitals in the same phase

### antibonding molecular orbital
![antibonding-molecular-orbital](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/219939009-a9798850-5fda-4196-8d7d-d931c45468d9.svg)[^4]
- higher energy, as the electrons have less space
- no covalent bonds formed, as the electrons are in different phases

# carbon valence electrons
- 1 electron is promoted from 2s to a space p orbital
- the energy required to promote this electron is regained when 4 covalent bonds form
- 2 kinds of orbital are used (2s, 2p), and so 2 types of C-H bond form
